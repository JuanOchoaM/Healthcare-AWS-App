# Healthcare-AWS-App

I designed and implemented a cloud-based web application resembling a simplified version of healthcare.gov using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Key Components

1. **Web Frontend Setup**: Launched and configured a Windows Server virtual machine (VM) on AWS EC2. Installed necessary software including IIS and Visual Studio Web Express 2013 to develop and run a web application.
2. **Database Configuration**: Created a cloud-based database using AWS RDS with Microsoft SQL Server. Designed the schema to store health insurance plans and user registration details.
3. **Web Functionality Implementation**: Developed the web application using ASP.NET. Implemented features for displaying health plans and allowing users to register for a plan. Ensured seamless interaction between the web frontend and the database.
4. **AWS Management and Security**: Managed security settings including creating security groups for secure RDP, HTTP, and MSSQL access. Utilized AWS services while monitoring costs using AWS credits.

## Skills Gained

- **Expertise in AWS services**, particularly EC2, RDS, and security configurations.
- **Experience in setting up and managing Windows Server environments**.
- **Proficiency in web development** using ASP.NET and SQL Server.
- **Practical skills in cloud application deployment and database integration**.
